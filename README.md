# Sanity CMS

We are using Sanity CMS to solve and shortcut a lot of our backend for this proyect. It provides a platform for easy and structure content creation and allows easy access for non-developers to publish content directly through it. Its a great tool and backend solution for this kind of projects.

If you want to deploy this project in your own environment, you will have to cretae a Sanity account and run a couple commands. Sanity guides you through it but for TLDR purposes you can run
```bash
npm install -g @sanity/cli
sanity init
``` 
Then you can just choose your project name, say yes to using the default dataset configuration, select a folder dedicated for the sanity backend to reside and choose "Blog (schema)" as our template.
